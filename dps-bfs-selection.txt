//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
BFS

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
BFS (DFS will take long time to do recursive traverse)

//If the tree is very wide:
DFS (BFS will take a lot of memory)

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
DFS

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
DFS

//Finding the shortest path:
BFS
